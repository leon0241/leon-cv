I've been doing technician work at the Edinburgh Fringe for the last 4 years, and have loved it every time! I really enjoy the variation of shows that come to perform and am always excited to get to know new companies. I also have done lots of work volunteering at the University of Edinburgh's theatre society, both as a Tech Manager of the theatre, and as a technician of show teams. I've got to know lots of amazing people through the society, and learnt a lot about tech, especially in Lighting design and Sound design. Through Bedlam, I also self-taught myself Vectorworks, and created a file of the building from the ground up for show teams to use in their lighting rigs.

As someone with a background in computer science, I'm always interested to learn new technology and techniques to improve as a technician. Especially discovering software like TheatreMix, and EOS with its extensive shortcuts and macro system, I feel like there is something new to learn in tech every day. Finding new optimisations to increase speed when LX programming is a lot of fun to me, and parallels my love for customising my neovim editor.
