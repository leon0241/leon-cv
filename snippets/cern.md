Hi,

I am writing to express my interest in being a Ceph Storage DevOps Engineer. As someone with a strong background in server work from studying a degree in Computer Science, I believe I have the skills to perform in this job. I have a huge respect for CERN as a company, and I would love to work at this company.

From studying at the University of Edinburgh, I have developed good discipline for balancing workloads, as well as a strong foundation to data science and analysis. I have a lot of experience in programming in Python, including data analysis with Juypter Notebooks, as well as knowledge on application deployment from a course on Software Testing. I also have gained a lot of mathematics experience including in Differential Equations, and Several Variable Calculus which I believe provides a good basis to work in this profession.

Outside my studies, I am interested in servers and have experience with deploying my own self-hosted server using an old PC, which runs a file server and a media server, as well as a dashboard using Prometheus and Grafana. My personal laptop runs Windows 10 dual booted with Arch Linux, as I enjoy staying up to date with the cutting edge releases, and I have used Linux to daily drive for my university work for the last two years. I used LaTeX for all my mathematics notes, and to use it efficiently I customised my own Neovim configuration with a comprehensive snippets system to keep up with lectures.

I have a strong interest in Technical Theatre, and from working at the Edinburgh Fringe as a Technical Manager, I have developed good interpersonal skills, as I was partially responsible for communication with the 23 shows performing at the theatre. I was the primary contact to the companies for technical requirements, both sorting out anything in the pre-production before the festival, and any issues that happened during the festival. Communication within the management team was also important for the festival to run smoothly, and I kept in good contact with the Venue Manager, Programmer, and Front of House Manager all throughout the Fringe to ensure there were no problems.





I have always admired the cutting edge of physics, and being part of CERN would be a dream. I believe I have the knowledge required to work here, and I am always willing and interested to learn anything new in order to successfully fulfill these roles. From my degree I have learned a lot about computing and I am very keen to use my skills to apply them at scale.

I have a lot of experience using git to manage my personal files, including the notes for all of my courses which I have written through LaTeX. I have also taken a course in Software Testing where we used CI/CD Pipelines through Github Actions, Jest, and Postman to automate the testing process of a simple JavaScript API.


I have configured my own home server running Promox VE, which runs on the local network and provides network file access for the devices at my home. The server is headless and I have experience using SSH as well as SSH'ing remotely through Tailscale. I keep backups of the server in case a container fails, and I have had to diagnose a container that failed due to a corrupt package. At my local Theatre, I have also set up a simple file server that the Lighting and Sound files are being backed up onto, in case a device fails.

I am running a NAS based on OpenMediaVault which currently has 10TB of storage, ~5TB of which is being utilised, which is running on my file server at my home. The NAS has specific directories that users on the network can connect to and I have set up the necessary users/groups needed to achieve this, and any other containers in the server also have the necessary drives mounted.


I also have a lot of knowledge with using Linux based systems, including my personal laptop as well as
