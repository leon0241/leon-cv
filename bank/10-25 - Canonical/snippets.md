I have daily driven a dualboot of Windows 10 and Arch Linux on my laptop for the past two years, where I used Linux for all the work in my degree, configuring any desktop features I needed myself. I have been using Wayland as my compositor through Hyprland, and recently switched to Niri. I also have made a custom Neovim setup which I have been using for the past two years and has been highly configured to meet my workflow needs.

I also have experience with server-side Linux from creating my own headless server, which was made using an old PC, along with Proxmox running Debian containers. I use the server regularly in my home as a media server and file server, as well as setting up pi-hole, and Tailscale for ssh'ing remotely.

I also have helped to maintain projects for the University's Theatre Society, including the updating of their Constitution which is hosted on Github, upkeep of the website, as well as maintaining a scale model of the Theatre using the CAD software Vectorworks.




For the past three years, I have written and maintained a repository of compact course notes for every Mathematics or Computer Science course I took in my degree. They were designed to be used as exam revision notes, and exam cheat-sheets, and were used by many students in my cohort, and have been passed down to previous years as well.

To create clear and well-formatted sections on the sheet, I also designed and created a LaTeX package for custom theorem boxes using the mdframed package, which you can configure to display different types of information (e.g. Definitions, Theorems, Lemmas). Later, I redesigned the package from scratch to add functionality and improve formatting errors by creating the boxes using the tcolorboxes package.

To aid the writing of large amounts of TeX documents, I also created my own snippets system using Neovim's Luasnips, which I have been building over the years. From the practice, by my final year I had optimised the snippets to the point where I was able to write TeX equations at the same pace as my Mathematics lectures.


From working at the Edinburgh Fringe as Technical Manager of Bedlam Fringe, I have developed good interpersonal skills, as I was partially responsible for communication with the 23 shows performing at the theatre. I was the primary contact to the companies for technical requirements, both sorting out anything in the pre-production before the festival, and any issues that happened during the festival.

Communication within the Fringe management team was also important for the festival to run smoothly, and I kept in good contact with the Venue Manager, Programmer, and Front of House Manager throughout the Fringe to ensure there were no problems.

I have also done work as part of an individual show's technical team which requires you to communicate well with the rest of the team over multiple months, since any Designers, Managers, Directors, Producers, or Actors all need to be kept in the loop in order to deliver a good final product.
