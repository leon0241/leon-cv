Dear Sir or Madam,
\medskip

I am writing to express my interest in the role of a Graduate Geospatial Consultant. As someone with a strong background in Computer Science, I believe I have a good foundation to perform in this job, and the perseverance to learn the necessary skills needed to excel. I am interested in the water sector, and am passionate about applying my knowledge of data science into the real world to make a positive impact.

\medskip

From my degree studying at the University of Edinburgh, I have developed good discipline for balancing workloads, as well as a strong foundation to data science and analysis. I have a lot of experience in applying data analysis in Python, including using Jupyter, and have experience in other languages like Java as well. I have also done a lot of mathematics experience including in Differential Equations and several variable calculus which I believe provides a good basis to work in this profession.

\medskip

I have 4 years of experience in technical theatre from volunteering at the Edinburgh University's student theatre society, Bedlam, where I have worked as Technical Manager of many shows. I enjoy pushing my limits in the Theatre scene, and notably I have experience self-teaching and designing using the CAD software Vectorworks for creating building designs for Theatre Auditoriums.

\medskip

From working at the Edinburgh Fringe as Technical Manager of Bedlam Fringe, I have developed good interpersonal skills, as I was partially responsible for communication with the 23 shows performing at the theatre. I was the primary contact to the companies for technical requirements, both sorting out anything in the pre-production before the festival, and any issues that happened during the festival. Communication within the management team was also important for the festival to run smoothly, and I kept in good contact with the Venue Manager, Programmer, and Front of House Manager all throughout the Fringe to ensure there were no problems.

\medskip

I hope my experience would be valuable, and thank you for looking at my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
\medskip

Sincerely,

Leon Lee.
