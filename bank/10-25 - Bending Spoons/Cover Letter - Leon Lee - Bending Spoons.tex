Dear Sir or Madam,
\medskip

I am writing to express my interest in the role of Graduate Software Engineer. As someone with a strong background in programming in Python, and a degree in Computer Science, I believe I have the skills to perform in this job, and the passion to pick up any new skills I would require.

\medskip

From my degree studying at the University of Edinburgh, I have developed good discipline for balancing workloads, as well as a strong ability in Python from various courses in various topics such as programming compilers, natural language processing, and data science. I also have experience programming in other languages like Java. Additionally, I have a lot of mathematics experience including in Differential Equations and several variable calculus which I believe provides a good basis to work in this field.

I have a lot of experience using git to manage my personal files, including the notes for all of my courses which I have written using LaTeX. I also have experience in test cycles from taking a course in Software Testing where we used CI/CD Pipelines through Github Actions, Jest, and Postman to automate the testing process of a simple JavaScript API.

\medskip

From working at the Edinburgh Fringe as Technical Manager of Bedlam Fringe, I have developed good interpersonal skills, as I was partially responsible for communication with the 23 shows performing at the theatre. I was the primary contact to the companies for technical requirements, both sorting out anything in the pre-production before the festival, and any issues that happened during the festival. Communication within the management team was also important for the festival to run smoothly, and I kept in good contact with the Venue Manager, Programmer, and Front of House Manager all throughout the Fringe to ensure there were no problems.

\medskip

I hope my experience would be valuable, and thank you for looking at my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
\medskip

Sincerely,

Leon Lee.
