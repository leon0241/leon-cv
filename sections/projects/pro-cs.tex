{LaTeX Notes System}
{\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a custom package using the tcolorbox and mdframed LaTeX packages, which creates compact and customisable theorem boxes for use in LaTeX documents.
	\item Using this package, I created an open course repository containing sets of notes for 11 courses I took throughout my degree for use in exams and revision.
