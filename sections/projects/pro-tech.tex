{Base Showfile - Bedlam Fringe 2025}
{\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and implemented a show file for the lighting plot used at the Bedlam Fringe 2025, a 90 seat Auditorium with a scaffolding rig.
    \item Used Vectorworks 2025 to create the lighting plot, and from that I created documentation, and an EOS show file with an Augment3d file, palettes, and a detailed magic sheet for shows to pre-program before the Fringe.

{Vectorworks - Bedlam Theatre}
{\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed a Vectorworks model of the Bedlam Theatre that can be exported to MVR for use in pre-visualisation software such as EOS Augment3d, or Vectorworks Vision. The model was designed using a basic floor plan and manual measurements. Created custom fixtures, classes, and layer structure to make the file accessible to technicians unfamiliar to the software and file.
